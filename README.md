So what does this mean for the humble hot dog?
If I was to place a sandwich and a hot dog in front of me, I could easily see that one is a hot dog, and one is a sandwich.

I donâ€™t see a sandwich and another sandwich with a frankfurter filling it.

So is a hot dog a sandwich? Absolutely not!!!!!!!!
